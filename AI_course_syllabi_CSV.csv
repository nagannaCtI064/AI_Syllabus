The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the capabilities of modern AI technologies, with an emphasis on being able to critically assess where they can provide societal value, and where they may create new challenges. The course is not intended to provide a deep-dive into the workings of these technologies in the same way as a computer science course might. Rather, business and policy decision-makers will be confronted with a number of important issues as AI becomes integrated into the social decision-making fabric. This course is intended to provide a framework for people who may have to confront these legal, ethical, and economic challenges. In doing so, an objective is to ensure that students who complete the course are comfortable enough in the inner-workings of these technologies to think critically across many AI contexts as well as different domains ranging from public policy, to criminal justice, to health inspections, HR, and marketing. The 0.5 CU course is oriented around hands-on critical written assessments, labs, exams, and a presentation. Broadly, data rich firms in finance, tech, management, marketing, and other industries are increasingly adopting AI as a tool to accelerate and improve decision-making. It is important for modern managers to understand the opportunities and challenges introduced by data and AI so that they can credibly communicate about these issues with others. We will cover many of these issues, so that you will be able to think about the opportunities and challenges that arise when firms try to use AI to solve business problems. Labs will reinforce your learning of how AI works, and how it is being used to solve business problems. During labs, we will focus on gaining experience with introductory machine learning concepts. Students will spend time inside and outside of the classroom combining data and code to provide a foundation for understanding the deep challenges that this will bring to organizations.","Session 1: Introduction + A brief history of AI

The course introduces support vector machines which provide a means for modeling data sets for the purposes of prediction, classification, regression, and novelty detection. We will study both their theoretical underpinnings and apply them to basic machine-learning problems with the help of the powerful R language and statistical computing system.

Support vector machines represent a functional modeling approach to machine learning, in that a support vector machine represents a function that is capable of assigning a class label or numerical value to each element of a data universe (the domain of the function). The rule of the function represents a generalization of the implicit patterns that exist in the sample data set. In the latter part of the course we will study a structural modeling approach, called ""frequent-pattern mining"", that searches for explicit patterns within a sample data set, and uses these patterns for prediction and classification. Frequent patterns may also be used to enrich a data set by adding features/attributes to the data that may help improve the performance of functional models.

The course will conclude with an introduction to ""ensemble learning"" techniques. These techniques combine different learning models for the same data set, and use them for the purpose of creating a learning model whose performance exceeds that of any individual model within the ensemble.","Overview of machine learning and knowledge discovery

People have approached the study of AI from various perspectives: philosophy, neurophysiology, mathematics, linguistics, psychology, control systems, and computer science, to name a few. Part of what makes it so interesting is the range of activities, from trying to understand minds in the abstract, to building creatures that run around and do things.

It has spawned several sub-areas (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, expert systems, and learning)

","This course is about the study of the design of intelligent computational
agents, and the emergence of Artificial Intelligence as an integrated science.
The focus is on an intelligent agent acting in an environment. The course
starts with simple agents acting in simple, static environments and gradually
increases the power of the agents to cope with more challenging worlds. The
course explores several dimensions of complexity introducing, gradually and
with modularity, what makes building intelligent agents challenging. This is
made concrete by repeatedly illustrating the ideas with different agent tasks,
such as a delivery robot and a diagnostic assistant: the science of Artificial
Intelligence is developed together with its engineering applications. The
agent we want the student to envision is a hierarchically designed agent that
acts intelligently in a stochastic environment that it can only partially observe

- one that reasons about individuals and relationships among them, has
complex preferences, learns while acting, takes into account other agents,
and acts appropriately given its own computational limitations

This course is about Machine
Learning techniques. The frontal lectures will focus on basic supervised and
unsupervised techniques and the labs will be about applying and comparing
these techniques on real datasets. Students will first learn how to represent
data and deal with different types of features. Then, they will dive into
learning supervised approaches for creating predictive models and

intelligent problem solving, planning, and communication skills to a wide range
of practical problems. In spite of the variety of problems addressed in artificial
intelligence research, a number of important features will emerge:
The use of computer to do reasoning, pattern recognition,
learning, or some other form of inference.

A focus on problems that do not respond to algorithmic
solutions.

A concern with problem solving using inexact, missing, or
poorly defined information and the use of representational
formalisms that enable the programmer to compensate for these
problems.

Reasoning about the significant qualitative features of a
sitution.


An attempt to deal with issues of semantic meaning as well as

United States,"University of Pennsylvania, home to the Wharton School",2023-01-01,"AI, Business, and Society",,"The course provides an overview of AI and its role in business transformation. The purpose of
this course is to improve understanding of AI, discuss the many ways in which AI is being used in the
industry, and provide a strategic framework for how to bring AI to the center of digital transformation
efforts. In terms of AI overview, we will go over a brief technical overview for students who are not actively
immersed in AI (topics covered include Big Data, data warehousing, datamining, machine learning, etc).
In terms of business applications, we will consider applications of AI in Media, Finance, Healthcare, Retail,
and other industries. Finally, we will consider how AI can be used as a source of competitive advantage.
We will conclude with a discussion of ethical challenges and a governance framework for AI. No prior
technical background is assumed but some interest in (and exposure to) technology is helpful. Every effort
is made to build most of the lectures from the basics. ","In session 1 we will discuss the transformative potential of AI. Specifically, we
will discuss AI’s promise as a General-Purpose Technology and look at data to
suggest that AI is likely to change most industries, thereby requiring
organizational change on the part of companies as well. We will hear from guest
speaker Jocelyn Goldfein of Zetta Venture Partners and will also begin to discuss
the basics of Big Data and data infrastructure in preparation for taking a deeper
dive into these topics in the next session. Students will walk away from this
session with an understanding that a data explosion is occurring and that new tools
like machine learning can be applied to this data to extract intelligence and
automate decision-making. Finally, I will introduce a simulation on A/B testing
that students will play as part of a later class session on reinforcement learning.
Topics in session 1:
● AI for Business Course Intro
● Is AI a General Purpose Technology?
● Basics of Big Data and data infrastructure
● Preview: Intro to A/B testing simulation


Session 2 will consist of a deep dive into Big Data. We will start with an overview
of what Big Data is, how it is being generated, and why it matters. We will then
go on to discuss some differences between traditional analytics and Big Data
analytics, the general skillset required for Big Data analysis, and tools for working
with Big Data. To this end, we will discuss tools for managing Big Data as well as
tools for analyzing Big Data. With regards to managing Big Data, we will discuss
data warehouses and will hear from speakers from Snowflake on this topic.
Regarding analyzing Big Data, we will discuss data mining tools like clustering
and association rule mining.
Topics in session 2:
● Big Data Overview
● Big Data Analysis
● Data Infrastructure
● Data Mining

Start of Module 02: Machine Learning
In session 3 we will discuss Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in
greater depth. We will cover what AI is, types of AI, a brief history of AI, and
expert systems as an early approach to building AI. We will then discuss machine
learning, a newer approach to AI that addresses the limitations of expert systems.
Our discussion of machine learning will cover the three types of ML (supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning) as well as factors that
influence accuracy in ML systems. We will discuss several specific ML methods
in depth (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks)
and introduce model selection.
Topics in session 3:
● Artificial Intelligence Overview
● Machine Learning Overview + Types of ML
● Accuracy of ML models
● Specific ML Methods: A Deep Dive
● Model Selection and Validation

This session will be largely focused on practicing the A/B testing simulation, in
which students will be testing different variants of a fictional ecommerce
webpage. Students will work with their teams to formulate strategies for the A/B
testing tournament. Additional details about the simulation and the tournament
mode are provided in the student instructions posted on Canvas. At the end of this
session, teams should have finalized their strategies for the in-class tournament in
the next session.

We will run the simulation in tournament mode. After experiencing manual A/B
testing in the simulation, we will then discuss the reinforcement learning concepts
of exploration and exploitation, as well as discuss how multi-armed bandits, the
type of reinforcement learning algorithm used to automate A/B testing, balances
these two concepts. Students will experience and understand some of the benefits
and drawbacks of both manual decision-making and AI-driven decision-making in
the context of A/B testing.
Topics in session 5:
● AI Simulation Game (come prepared to class with your strategy)
● Reinforcement Learning
● Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs)

We will discuss challenges associated with model training, such as overfitting, in
detail. We will also discuss validation strategies such as split training and testing,
k-fold cross validation, and iterative cross validation. Additionally, we will look at
a sample dataset and ML code (in Python) to understand how data preparation,
model setup, and validation works in practice. The goal of this session is not
necessarily to learn coding but instead to help students understand what the
application of ML in practice looks like. Students will also appreciate how data
preparation and interpretation of results are often more time consuming than
coding of any ML model.
Topics in session 4:
● Quiz 02 (primary focus: sessions 3, 4 & 5)
● Training and validation
● ML in practice
● Intro to Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook (Run code live)

In this session, we will discuss ML Ops. Specifically, we will cover the practices
and tools of traditional Dev Ops and how ML Ops differs from these. For
example, we will discuss some of the unique challenges associated with ML Ops,
especially with regards to testing and performance monitoring. We will also
discuss existing tools for ML Ops as well as the concept of model interpretability
as part of the ML Ops workflow. I’ll also intro you to several WYSWYG tools for
ML that you may find helpful as non-data scientists who might be users of Ml
tools in your careers
Topics in session 5:
● ML Ops
● AutoML (Google cloud)
● Teachable Machines
● TensorFlow Playground

Generative AI: In this session, we’ll explore the recent explosion in Generative AI
tools like Stable Diffusion and GPT3 and the implications for business and
society

This session will concentrate on how AI augments personalization on the web, and
will cover types of recommender systems and how they work, the impact of
personalization on markets, and challenges associated with personalization
systems. We will cover content-based recommenders, collaborative filters, and
hybrid recommender systems in depth, and we will use several well-known music
streaming services to illustrate how these various recommender systems are used
in practice as well as the differences between them. Students will also come away
with an understanding that personalization goes beyond product
recommendations, instead encompassing customer interactions more broadly.
Time permitting, we will also discuss Autonomous Vehicles as another
application of AI.
Topics in session:
● Recommender Systems
● Impact of recommenders on markets
● Other forms of personalization on the web
● Challenges with personalization
● ML in Finance: Fraud Detection
● ML in Finance: Additional applications

Session 10 will be the first of two class sessions on AI Strategy and Governance.
Students will walk away with an understanding that, to create an edge with AI,
companies need to not only use AI, but create the right strategic frameworks and
organizational processes around AI. To this end, we will begin by discussing how
AI can drive business transformation, with a particular focus on the idea that
transformative technologies like AI are often difficult to apply initially, but
companies that persevere tend to benefit. We will then move into discussing how
companies can apply AI more effectively by taking a portfolio approach to AI
projects. We will also discuss how the democratization of machine learning is
lowering barriers to AI use from a technical standpoint. With regards to
organizational structure, we will discuss five specific organizational strategies that
can help companies generate value from AI.
Topics in session 10:
● AI-Driven Business Transformation
● Developing a Portfolio of AI Projects
● Lowering Barriers for AI Use
● AI in the Organization Structure 

In session 11 we will continue our discussion around AI Strategy and Governance,
focusing on the risks that AI technologies bring and how certain governance
guidelines can help manage those risks. Specifically, students will come away
with an understanding of how algorithms can make discriminatory decisions, a
serious social risk. We will also discuss how social risks can lead to additional
risks for firms, such as reputational, legal, and regulatory risks. We will discuss

how providing some user control and calibrated transparency, as well as
implementing audits, can all help to manage these risks.
Topics in session 11:
● Risks with AI
● AI Governance
● Trends in AI
● Course Takeaways

Italy,School of Innovation,2022-01-01,AI in Everyday Life,,"So, what is AI really? We’ve all heard the hype - as well as the doom and gloom - surrounding
Artificial Intelligence. Will AI make our lives easier, by providing us with the futuristic gadgets
that we see in sci-fi movies? Or, will it take over humanity, becoming smarter than us and
replacing us as decision makers in our own lives? What is all this talk about AI driving the Fourth
Industrial Revolution and what does it mean for young people who will soon be entering the
workforce…or for those who entered the workforce before the rise of AI?
The truth is that “targeted” or “narrow” AI is already a big part of our lives. Narrow AI
applications aim at carrying out very specific tasks, and they have been evolving rapidly in
recent decades. From the use of technologies such as ""Siri"" or ""Alexa,"" which help us execute
voice-activated commands, to the use of the Google search engine that returns the information
we requested in just a few seconds, or even when we discover interesting content on social
networks, we are using AI. In this course, we will draw on our familiarity with such “everyday”
applications, to explore the technical, but also social and ethical aspects, of the modern AI
paradigm.
The main objective of the course is to help you appreciate what today’s AI is, as well as to
understand the basic elements of AI technologies, and how they are developed. You will
become familiar with the fundamental definitions and concepts around AI, but also the
widespread methods used in the creation of systems. In particular, an introduction to data-driven
AI, based on machine learning, is provided. The role of personal data in the AI ecosystem -
provided to companies via the use of services such as search engines and social media - will
also be discussed.
In addition to examining the fundamental concepts surrounding the technical aspects of Narrow
AI, we will also examine the ethical and social implications of its widespread use. You will learn
to analyze the functions of ""everyday"" AI applications and will be able to understand the
potential risks of these technologies, and to critically evaluate them.","Introduction to the course

United States,University of Michigan,2024-01-01,Artificial Intelligence for Business,,"We are living in fast changing world. The amount of information we generate, receive and process is
increasing at an exponential rate. This information explosion is empowering a wave of smart, automated
functionalities like face recognition, tumor detection, automatic inventory control systems, self-driving
cars, virtual assistants, robo-advisors, automated product/service recommendations and so on. These
technologies and tools will be even more important in the future for individuals, businesses and other
organizations since they drive innovation, save costs, increase quality for products and services, and
simplify daily life for humans.
The mechanism behind these new technologies and tools is artificial intelligence (AI), which allows
computers and machines to automate the business logic – to work, react and engage like humans. The
basic premise is to use data and mathematical models to predict and prescribe to obtain better
outcomes. AI comes with a great promise for individuals, organizations and societies but at the same
time there are considerable risks and unsolved implications such as reduction in employment,
responsibility determination when AI fails (e.g., crash of a self-driving car, a wrong disease diagnosis)
and ethical dilemmas (e.g., a patient death, automatic missile launch).
Future business leaders need to understand and leverage the potential of AI, its capability for consumers
and organizations as well as its risks and ethical considerations. AI based products and tools will not
only be an advantage for businesses but a necessity to remain competitive in the future. This course
aims to provide students with a conceptual introduction of AI, a broad understanding of AI’s basic
techniques, how AI is applied to problems, how to extract value from AI investments, future applications
of AI and an awareness of the challenges, risks and ethical considerations of use of AI in business.
The course is aimed towards general business students and does not require a technical background.
Students will be able to connect the conceptual nature of this course with the more technical coverage
of AI related material in other Ross TO courses – but they are not expected to be familiar with the
technical details of AI as a pre-requisites","First two weeks will focus on providing a general introduction to the current start of the art in the
practice of AI in business. We will also go through a discussion of historical roots of AI’s development
and the merging of the AI domain with the Big Data domain. After this module, students will have an
understanding of the current nature of AI in business and the current and future role of AI in delivering
business value and enabling new business models. 


In our first deep dive in the “inside” of AI, we will look at the most popular form of AI in business today –
the one of prediction, of automating the decision making process, most commonly with the use of large
amount of data (Big Data) along with Machine Learning algorithms to get insights from the data. We will
discuss both the historical, data-light version of decision making approaches such as Searching,
Adversarial Searching and Constraint Satisfaction Problems as well as the Big Data version of automating
decision making using Machine Learning and its most recent incarnation – Deep Learning


AI technologies are becoming more “human-like” with advances on natural language processing and
cognitive computing. Customer service is being transformed using automated Chatbots while personal
digital assistants like Alexa are breaking new grounds in conversational natural language processing. In
this module we will discuss the role of language and human-like cognitive processes in the context of AI.
We will extend the discussion to more purely-human aspects such as creativity and emptions. Finally, as
the distinction between human and machine narrows, we will discuss the role of trust in AI systems. 

We transition from software to hardware in this module. We connect the AI discussion so far to the
ongoing advances in Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Devices and in particular, Autonomous Vehicles. We
will discuss the merging of the AI domain with the Robotics domain with the emergence of human-like
robots like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas. We will extend the robotics discussion to Software Robots, especially
those used for RPA (Robotic Process Automation) and making business processes more efficient. 

We go from “what” to “how” in this module. How to implement AI based solutions in an organization?
How to make AI adoption successful in an organization? How to think about new business models and
new process structures to leverage AI capabilities? What are the main challenges and potential risks of
different approaches? We will specifically focus on the role of organizational culture and transformative
leadership in managing the digital transformation process. 

We conclude the course content by looking at the “other side” of AI. We will look at potential risks that
organizations face by automating decision making and removing or reducing human oversight of
automated tools. We will broaden our enquiry to consider the impact of AI on society, specifically the
labor force. We will also explore regulatory responses to various challenges posed by AI. 

We will hold the last week of the class for potential guest speakers from industry and for holding project
presentation for the group projects. We will conclude the class with one final Learning Journal
submissions – a capstone submission to capture overall reflections on the course content.
